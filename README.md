# How to fix when getting errors based of imports

Run this command (backend path: m3ssaging, frontend path: m3ssaging/m3ssaging):
```shell
yarn
```

If still getting errors "module not found" go to https://www.npmjs.com/ and install the package

To run our frontend in localhost run this command in m3ssaging/m3ssaging
```shell
yarn run dev
```
